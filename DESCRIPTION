Description: This package provides functions for performing nonbipartite
    matching and matched randomization. A "bipartite" matching utilizes two
    separate groups, e.g. smokers being matched to nonsmokers or cases being
    matched to controls. A "nonbipartite" matching creates mates from one big
    group, e.g. 100 hospitals being randomized for a two-arm cluster randomized
    trial or 5000 children who have been exposed to various levels of
    secondhand smoke and are being paired to form a greater exposure vs. lesser
    exposure comparison. At the core of a nonbipartite matching is a NxN
    distance matrix for N potential mates. The distance between two units
    expresses a measure of similarity or quality as mates (the lower the
    better). The 'gendistance()' and 'distancematrix()' functions assist in
    creating this. The 'nonbimatch()' function creates the matching that
    minimizes the total sum of distances between mates; hence, it is referred
    to as an "optimal" matching. The 'assign.grp()' function aids in performing
    a matched randomization. Note the package can also perform bipartite
    matching using the prevent option in 'gendistance()'.
